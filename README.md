# URL Shortener

The idea of this project is to study some technologies and practice. Here you will find a URL shortener like [bit.ly](http://bit.ly).

## How to use
1. In the home page you can find an input text. Type the URL there and press Enter/Submit button
2. It will generate a short URL. 
3. If you click in the short URL you will be redirect to the original URL
4. To get the statistics you just add a plus (_+_) signal in the end of the URL, example:
    * URL: _localhost:8000/2A14S6REML_
    * Short URL: _localhost:8000//2A14S6REML+_

Obs: Replace the _localhost:8000_ by your domain


## Libraries
* Django
* Django Rest Framework
* Bootstrap
* JQuery


## To Do
* [ ] Enhance the logic for redirect URL. ItÂ´s not working for all the URLs
* [ ] Add the automatic build (Circleci)
* [ ] Add test cases for BE and FE
